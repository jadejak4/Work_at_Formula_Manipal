Hi, hope this finds you well.
The above repo summarizes majority of the technical work that was executed by myself, during my tenure at Formula Manipal.

Broadly speaking my proejcts at FM included:
1) Hardware & Firmware Design of a Data Acqusition system for a formula student car.
2) Integrating a telemetry system using Xbee modules & displaying data using a GUI
3) Designing & manufracturing a wiring harness, compatible with the mechanical design and Engine Control Unit
4) Designing, prototyping & designing PCBs for digital circuits used in the shutdown system for the car.
